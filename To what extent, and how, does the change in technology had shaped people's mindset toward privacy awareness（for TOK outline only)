'## Possible Bullet Point Framework:
- Ancient China: guest registration at inns 
- Privacy != right, but a method of state control
- Maslow: awareness depends on fulfilled lower-tier needs
- Without food/safety, people trade privacy for survival
- Survivor bias: people who care about privacy = already safe
- Majority of voices online are survivors → discourse distortion
- Privacy anxiety is real, but may be overrepresented by privileged groups, by survivor bias

## Future Use:
- This framework may be expanded into TOK Essay or Presentation, etc..
